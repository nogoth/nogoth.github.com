Game plan for the short term is to take yasnippets and craft up a template
that i can use to make new entries in the blog as well as the dates that 
they are supposed to have as part of their name. 
 Of course then I'll have to post that project, if i can, to github for other
people using jekyll to have at their fingertips.
